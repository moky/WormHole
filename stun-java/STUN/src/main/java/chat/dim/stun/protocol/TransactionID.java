 *
 *   Transaction ID
 *   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *   The magic cookie field MUST contain the fixed value 0x2112A442 in
 *   network byte order.  In RFC 3489 [RFC3489], this field was part of
 *   the transaction ID; placing the magic cookie in this location allows
 *   a server to detect if the client will understand certain attributes
 *   that were added in this revised specification.  In addition, it aids
 *   in distinguishing STUN packets from packets of other protocols when
 *   STUN is multiplexed with those other protocols on the same port.
 *
 *   The transaction ID is a 96-bit identifier, used to uniquely identify
 *   STUN transactions.  For request/response transactions, the
 *   transaction ID is chosen by the STUN client for the request and
 *   echoed by the server in the response.  For indications, it is chosen
 *   by the agent sending the indication.  It primarily serves to
 *   correlate requests with responses, though it also plays a small role
 *   in helping to prevent certain types of attacks.  The server also uses
 *   the transaction ID as a key to identify each transaction uniquely
 *   across all clients.  As such, the transaction ID MUST be uniformly
 *   and randomly chosen from the interval 0 .. 2**96-1, and SHOULD be
 *   cryptographically random.  Resends of the same request reuse the same
 *   transaction ID, but the client MUST choose a new transaction ID for
 *   new transactions unless the new request is bit-wise identical to the
 *   previous request and sent from the same transport address to the same
 *   IP address.  Success and error responses MUST carry the same
 *   transaction ID as their corresponding request.  When an agent is
 *   acting as a STUN server and STUN client on the same port, the
 *   transaction IDs in requests sent by the agent have no relationship to
 *   the transaction IDs in requests received by the agent.
