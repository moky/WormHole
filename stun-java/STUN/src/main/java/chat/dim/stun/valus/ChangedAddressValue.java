/*  11.2.3  CHANGED-ADDRESS
 *
 *        The CHANGED-ADDRESS attribute indicates the IP address and port where
 *        responses would have been sent from if the "change IP" and "change
 *        port" flags had been set in the CHANGE-REQUEST attribute of the
 *        Binding Request.  The attribute is always present in a Binding
 *        Response, independent of the value of the flags.  Its syntax is
 *        identical to MAPPED-ADDRESS.
 *
 *    (Defined in RFC-3489, removed from RFC-5389)
